Does not run on latest version of node for some reason. Def works on v10.16.0, so use that one!

if you don't have it, install it!

`nvm install 10.16.0`

Then use it!

`nvm use 10.16.0`

Then run the thing!

`node index.js`

Only that actually wont work either coz the gmail deets are all pretend

:D
